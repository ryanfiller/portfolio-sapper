I can't find a source for the first person who said this, but it is a well known best practice to "commit small; commit often." And this is great!

It takes me on average 10 commits to make a blog post, plus that number will make for easy math.

This number is WAY worse if you're using a git based CMS (link to post about NetlifyCMS).
